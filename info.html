            <p class="userGuideTxt">Binary is a number system used in computers and digital electronics. It is fundamentally different 
                from the decimal system that we use in everyday life, which is based on 10 digits (0-9). In contrast, binary uses only 
                two digits: 0 and 1. This might seem limited, but it's perfect for representing information in digital devices because 
                they operate with two basic states: on (1) and off (0). Let's start with the basics of binary representation:
                <br><br><br>
                1. Binary Digits (Bits): <br><br>
                In binary, each digit is called a "bit". As mentioned earlier, a bit can only have two values, 0 or 1. It's the smallest 
                unit of information in the binary system.
                <br><br>
                2. Binary Numbers: <br><br>
                Binary numbers are constructed by arranging bits in a sequence, similar to how decimal numbers are formed by arranging 
                digits (0-9). In binary, numbers are read from right to left, with the rightmost digit representing the smallest value. 
                <br><br>
                Here's a simple binary number:
                <br><br><br>
                Example 1: Binary number 10110 <br><br>
                
                In this example, the rightmost digit (0) represents 2^0 (which equals 1 in decimal), the next digit to the left (1) 
                represents 2^1 (which is 2 in decimal), the next 1 represents 2^2 (4 in decimal), and so on. You add these values 
                together to get the decimal equivalent of the binary number.</p>
