            <p class="blogText">Binary is a base 2 number system, which means that it can only be represented by 2 characters: 1, and 0.
                Because of this, to understand what a binary number is, we have to convert it into denary, base 10. To do this, we take a
                given binary number: <b>11011101</b> <br><br>We can work this out by doing: <br><br> 128 + 64 = 192 <br> 16 + 8 = 24 <br> 
                4 + 1 = 5 <br> 192 + 24 = 216 + 5 = 221 <br> <br> <b>11011101</b> = 221 <br><br> However, that takes a very long time, and 
                requires a piece of paper (unless your very good at mental maths). <br><br>Because of this, I have come up with a method that
                allows you to look at a binary number, any length, 1 or even 8 digits, and immediately know what it is in base 10. The method 
                involves memorising just 15 binary combinations then you will know all of them, and if you already know a little about binary,
                you will know that binary numbers with 8 digits have 255 different combinations: 00000000 - 11111111. <br><br> To perform this
                method you will need to take a given binary number: <b>11001011</b>. Now lets do step 1: <br><br><br><b>1. Split</b> <br><br>
                Firstly, split the number into 2 separate lengths: <b>1100 | 1011</b>. We will call these the upper bound, and the lower bound.
                The upper bound will always be on the left and the lower on the right. <br><br><b>2. Recall</b> <br><br>For the upper bound
                there are 15 different combinations (0001, 0010, 0011, etc.) each of these have a uppere bound number assigned to them, recall 
                which one it is for this case: it is 192, since 128 + 64 = 192. <br><br><b>3. Sum</b><br><br>Now you have the hard part done, 
                you can just work out in your head the lower bound. We know that the digit furthest right is 1, next to that is 2, and then 4, 
                however 4 is a 0 so we skip it, and then 8. 1 + 2 + 8 = 11. <br><br>192 + 11 = 203 <br><br>Here are the combinations you need to 
                remember: <br><br>0001 = 16 <br>0010 = 32 <br>0011 = 48 <br>0100 = 64 <br> 0101 = 80 <br>0110 = 96 <br> 0111 = 112 <br>1000 = 128 
                <br> 1001 = 144 <br> 1010 = 160 <br> 1011 = 176 <br> 1100 = 192 <br> 1101 = 208 <br> 1110 = 224 <br> 1111 = 240 <br><br> Once you
                have memorised those, you are good to go. <br> <hr>
